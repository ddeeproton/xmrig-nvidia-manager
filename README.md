# Description: 

"Xmrig Manager" helps to avoid temperature exceeding on graphic card when using xmrig application. 

![](preview_v1.1.3.png)

If the temperature exceeds limit, then mining is stopped for 2 minutes. 

Actually, this Manager is compatible with one graphic card only. If you mine with two or more graphic cards, you have to use one "XMRIG Manager"'s instance per graphic card (and stored in a different directory). 

# How to use?

1. Download and configure xmrig

2. Set the path of xmrig into "XMRIG Manager".

3. Press button Start in "XMRIG Manager".
