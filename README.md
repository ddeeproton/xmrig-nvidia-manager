# Description: 

"Xmrig Manager" helps to avoid temperature to exceed on graphic card when using xmrig-nvidia application and remove donation for xmrig and xmrig-nvidia.

If the temperature exceeds limit, then mining will be stopped for 2 minutes. 

If donation detected, then mining will be restarted. 

Actually, this Manager is compatible with only one graphic card. If you mine with two or more graphic card, you have to use one "XMRIG Manager"'s instance per graphic card (and stored in a different directory). 

# How to use?

1. Download and configure xmrig or xmrig-nvidia.

2. Set the path of xmrig or xmrig-nvidia into "XMRIG Manager".

3. Press button Start in "XMRIG Manager".
